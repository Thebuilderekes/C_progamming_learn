## Structure of a C program

- Every C program has a `main()`` function that has a return type of `int`` that is
either `return 0` or `return 1`.


## Working with strings in C
- Strings are array of characters in C that can should be terminated by a ``/0``
when it is read else C does not know how to read a string. So C relies on us to
keep track of our arrays.
- Single quotes are used for individual characters while double quotes are used
for strings.
