## Structure of a C program

- Every C program has a `main()`` function that has a return type of `int`` that is
either `return 0` or `return 1`.
- You can write custom functions outside the main function and call your custom
functions while passing them arguments in the main function.
- You can have a void function that does not have a return value.
For example `void functionName()`
- An expression has a return value. That means that  `x=4` has a return value of `4`


## Working with strings in C
- Strings are array of characters in C that can should be terminated by a ``/0``
when it is read else C does not know how to read a string. So C relies on us to
keep track of our arrays.
- Single quotes are used for individual characters while double quotes are used
for strings.


## The compiler


# Control flow
- You can use `switch` statement in C
